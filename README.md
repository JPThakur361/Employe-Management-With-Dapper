# DapperDemo(Employee Management)

I have implemented Dapper, one of my preferred ORMs, using the Repository Pattern and compared it with Entity Framework. For this project, you will need Visual Studio 2019 and SQL Server Management Studio 2019.

Here are some straightforward steps to get started:

Begin by selecting a .NET MVC web application template in Visual Studio.
Utilize the NuGet Package Manager Console to generate database tables in SQL Server Management Studio.
Don't forget to update your system name in the connection string to ensure seamless connectivity.
These steps will help you set up the environment and database structure for your project. Let me know if you need further assistance or clarification on any of these steps.
